# Intro to Data Science — Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases a series of data science projects completed as part of a university-level Introduction to Data Science course. Each folder contains a standalone project or assignment focused on building core data science skills, including data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.

These projects demonstrate our hands-on experience with the data science lifecycle: from data cleaning and exploration to predictive modeling and evaluation.

## Key Skills & Tools

    Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras)

    Concepts: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Deep Learning

    Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    Practices: Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation
    
## Project Overview


### Project – Final Data Science Project

    Objective: Conduct end-to-end data science analysis.

    Highlights:

        Explored a larger dataset with multiple features.

        Applied the entire pipeline: cleaning → feature engineering → modeling.

        Compared different models and summarized key findings.

    Skills: Full pipeline implementation, reporting, model comparison.
#### Pipeline Stages: 
    
1.	Data Collection:  
•	Engineered robust web scraping system using Selenium and Beautiful Soup, using it to scrap Letterboxd

3.	Data Preprocessing:  
•	Performed extensive cleaning, handling inconsistencies and formatting issues

5.	Feature Engineering:  
•	Created novel engagement metrics from user interaction data 
•	Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables

7.	Exploratory Analysis:  
•	Uncovered correlations between movie features and rating 
•	Visualized various movie feature data

9.	Modeling:  
•	Implemented 5 ML models (SVM, Neural Networks, Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees) 
•	Optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter tuning 
•	Applied PCA to improve model performance
